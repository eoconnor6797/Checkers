# Checkers

## How to play

On the index page there are two input forms
  * Name - your name (or the name you would like to play as)
  * Game - the game you would like to join
    think of this as a key that you will share will the player you would like to play against
    
When the form is submitted you will join the specified game under the specified name
The first to people to join said game will be the players, the first person will control the black pieces
the second person will control the white pieces. Anyone else that joins that game will be a spectator.
The player controlling the black pieces has the first turn.

The rules are the same as standard checkers except for two thing:
  * there are no forced jumps
  * and there are no multijumps.

You can withdraw at anytime by pressing the withdraw button.

On a game reset, the same players will still be controlling the same pieces but the board will have been reset.
